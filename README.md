Hi, my name is Lachlan.  I am a web developer currently enrolled at 
Bloc, a Front End Web Development Career Path Bootcamp.  I love
being presented with new challenges because I see them as an opportunity to grow.  
I am passionate about growing as a web developer learning the languages, 
understanding frameworks, and how front ends and back ends work together. 

Outside of coding, I have been a life-long musician.  I have played drums
my whole life growing up in school jazz bands, rock bands, and touring
the country.  I enjoy surfing and rock climbing as a pass time activity.
I am a life long learner of the world and the things that inspire me.

My current projects are:<br>
1.  Interactive Quiz App<br>
    Title: Drum History Quiz<br>
    Description: Interactive quiz app that takes users through a series of <br>
             questions and provides them feedback on whether the answer<br>
             is right or wrong.  Also, updates the score and question<br>
             number and calculates a passing or failing score, which<br>
             results in a pass or fail screen prompting the user to<br>
             restart the quiz.<br>
    List of Technologies Used:<br>
        1. VSCode<br>
        2. git/github<br>
        3. HTML/CSS/JS<br>
